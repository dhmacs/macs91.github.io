            This minimum viable visualization uses force layout to avoid as much as possible overlapping between nodes.
            They idea comes from my master thesis project, that is a visualization of Public Transport Systems that enables
            interaction-free route planning. In this little demo I am experimenting the use of a force layout as a way to
            avoid overlapping. This approach can be applied to an animated map of Public Transport System making every landmark
            and vehicles part of a force layout that applies a charge on each of these nodes in order to keep them apart from
            each other. Ideally this approach could improve the legibility of the map with a minimal impact on the topology.
