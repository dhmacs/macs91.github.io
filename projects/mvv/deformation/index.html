            In this minimum viable visualization I am experimenting the usage of space deformation to improve the legibility
            of overviews of high amount of data. The space deformation is updated as the moving object moves around in the map.
            This approach can be applied to the domain of Public Transport Systems to improve the legibility of accessibility
            related information, such as reachable landmarks using public transit. The distortion allows to reveal more
            detailed information. In this dummy example the additional information is the number of the node. In an application
            to the public transport systems this information could be the shape of the landmarks, or the logo of the landmark
            (i.e. McDonald). Note also that even if in this example the focus of the distortion is on the moving object,
            we can also obtain a distortion that is function of multiple points (multiple vehicles).
